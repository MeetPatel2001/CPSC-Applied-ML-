HAVING EXTENSIVE ELECTRICAL EXPERIENCE IN MY 76 YEARS  I BEGAN INVESTIGATING BY PLUGGING IN MY $5 THREE-LIGHT 120-VOLT RECEPTACLE TESTER  AND FOUND (TO MY AMAZEMENT) HOT AND NEUTRAL REVERSED ON THIS $2000 PIECE OF GEAR.  AN ONLINE SEARCH OF '120 VOLT RECEPTACLE HOT NEUTRAL REVERSED' WILL AMPLY DESCRIBE WHY THIS IS INCORRECT AND DANGEROUS  SO I WON'T GO INTO THAT HERE.  I THEN SEARCHED ONLINE FORUMS TO SEE IF ANYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT SUCH A PROBLEM  AND FOUND MULTIPLE EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME EXPERIENCE WHO HAD MADE THE COMPANY AWARE OF THE PROBLEM  AND RECEIVED REPLACEMENT UNITS WITHOUT THE PROBLEM.  OTHERS WHO BOUGHT UNITS LONG AFTER THE PROBLEM WAS MADE KNOWN TO THE COMPANY  AND SUPPOSEDLY FIXED  REPORTED RECEIVING UNITS WITH THE PROBLEM.  APPARENTLY  THE COMPANY PRODUCED MANY UNITS  WITH THE PROBLEM BUILT INTO A RANDOM SUBSET OF THE UNITS  DUE TO INADEQUATE INSTRUCTIONS AND SUBSEQUENT TESTING.  THEN THE UNITS WERE SENT TO MULTIPLE STOCK POINTS.  UPON LEARNING OF THE PROBLEM  THE APPROPRIATE ACTION BY THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL AND 'STOP SALE' ORDER  SINCE DETECTING THE PROBLEM IS EASY AND CHEAP.  THE COMPLICATING FACTORS ARE THAT THE UNIT WEIGHS 67 POUNDS  AND THE PACKAGING IS HEAVY DUTY AND STRAPPED FOR [REDACTED] SHIPMENT  AND THE MULTIPLE STOCK POINTS.  OPENING THE SHIPMENT UNITS TO DO THE SIMPLE TEST IS TAXING  SO THUS FAR  THE COMPANY HAS JUST CONTINUED TO SHIP OUT UNITS LIKE THERE IS NO PROBLEM  AND REPLACE THE PROBLEM UNITS AS THEY ARE IDENTIFIED AND RETURNED.  THE PROBLEM WITH THIS APPROACH IS THAT MANY DEVICES WILL OPERATE IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE NORMAL FASHION  BUT WITH THE RISK OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK THAT COMES WITH THE REVERSED LEADS.  THE TYPICAL CUSTOMER MAY HAVE NO DEVICES (AS I DID) THAT CHECK FOR THE REVERSAL AND REFUSE TO POWER UP.  THE TYPICAL CUSTOMER WILL HAVE NO EXPERIENCE THAT LEADS THEM TO LOOK FOR SUCH A PROBLEM  AND NO TOOLS TO IDENTIFY IT  AND WILL SUFFER THE RISK WITHOUT ANY WARNING.\n",
